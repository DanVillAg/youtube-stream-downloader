# What is this?
Use Python to download YoutubeLiveVideo, FOREEVER!!!!!

I used this to construct a long duration video dataset for my research.

# How?
We also use apscheduler, so it will download the video every hour.

Python3.5 required.

# What should I do?
change the url in the downloader.py to the video you want.

# Requirements? Usage?
you need apscheduler and streamlink:

```
git clone https://github.com/kentaroy47/youtube-stream-downloader.git
pip install apscheduler
sudo apt install streamlink
```

Then, run:

```
python downloader.py

```
